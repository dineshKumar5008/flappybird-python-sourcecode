Flappy Bird Clone in Python 🐦
This repository contains the source code for a Flappy Bird clone, built in Python using the Pygame library. Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive 2D arcade game where players control a bird, navigating it through a series of obstacles (pipes) by tapping to make the bird "flap" and stay airborne.

Features 📋
Classic Gameplay: Faithful recreation of the original Flappy Bird mechanics.
Pygame-Powered: Built using Python and the Pygame library, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
Dynamic Obstacles: Randomly generated pipe positions to keep the game challenging and unpredictable.
Scoring System: Track your score as you successfully pass through pipes.
Collision Detection: Lose the game if the bird collides with pipes or falls off the screen.
Simple Graphics: Retro-style graphics reminiscent of the original game.
Replay Option: Easily restart the game to try for a better score.
Prerequisites 📦
Make sure you have Python installed along with the Pygame library. To install Pygame, 
pip install pygame
